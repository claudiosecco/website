      <p class="lead my-4 text-muted">About Me</p>
      <div class="text-muted">
        With over 30 years of experience in the finance industry, I've had the privilege of working in various capacities within large financial service firms, startups, and fintech companies. Throughout my career, I've gained invaluable insights into the intricacies of financial markets, investment strategies, and risk management. My passion for finance is unwavering, and I continually strive to stay abreast of the latest trends and developments in the ever-evolving landscape of global finance.
        <br><br>
        Beyond my professional endeavors, I am a devoted musician, finding solace and inspiration in the melodies that fill the air. Music has always been a fundamental part of my life, providing me with a creative outlet and a means of expression that transcends language barriers.
        <br><br>
        In addition to my love for music, I am also an enthusiastic programmer. Exploring the world of coding allows me to merge my analytical mindset with my penchant for problem-solving, enabling me to create innovative solutions and explore new technological frontiers.
        <br><br>
        Whether it's analyzing financial data, composing melodies, or writing code, I approach each endeavor with dedication, passion, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. I believe in the power of continuous learning and growth, and I am excited to embark on new challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
